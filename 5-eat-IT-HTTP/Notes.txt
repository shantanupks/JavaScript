----------------------

===> state/model/ui-data is scattered across UI components
===> state & state-change logic & network/service calls 
     are tightly-coupled with UI components
===> if same state is required in multiple components 
     either we should duplicate that state in components or we should pass via input properties 
===> Unit-Testing is very difficult in components
===> we cant re-use same components across diffent pages or application

soln:

   ==> isolate common state & state change logic 
       & n/wing logic from UI components
   
 How ?

   in NG , using NG service classes     


   what is NG service ?

   -> a object , holds common state / logic for multiple UI components


   features of NG-services

   --> by default all NG services are singleton 
   --> thru DI , UI componentes can get service instances
